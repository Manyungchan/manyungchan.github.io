  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am graphic designer, this is my portfolio of what I did in art 74, an introduction to new media arts.In here you can find my previous work that I did in that class.</p>
  <p> I enjoy doing digital art. From video editing to making logos. I love seeing my progress as I build myself as an artist.
