  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Mandy. I am third year graphic designer student at San Jose State University. This is the portfolio of my career as a graphic designer. In here you can find my previous work that I did in my digital media class or on my own terms.</p>
  <p> In my spare time, you can find me at the gym, at the kitchen cooking or sitting in front of a laptop for hours to make art happen. I enjoy doing digital art, because it makes me feel excited when I finish a project. I love creating art, from videos editing to making logos or web designing. I love seeing my progress in digital art as I build myself as an artist. You can get in touch with me through the contact page if you discover my arts interest you.
