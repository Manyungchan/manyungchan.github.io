  <h3> "???", Digital Art, Spring 2019</h3>
  <p>Our group's concept was random.I guess we were trying to mix things that would look special and funny in the end. It turned out very cool and I like it. The glitching was not as much, I had to explore in audacity to make more glitch on my image.

  <h3>  "The Ocean Clams my Restless Soul", Digital Image, Spring 2019</h3>
  <p> I googled a pink sea photo. Then I photoshopped SpongeBob, Patrick, a suffer girl , four dolphins, changed two dolphins' color to pink and added a quote that says "The Ocean Clams my Restless Soul". This composite art represents how I feel about the winter, I am so over with this cold weather and hope summer comes sooner. I also really want a vacation near the ocean, a quick escape from my academics because I am so busy these days.
